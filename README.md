# KYC Verification System

A comprehensive *Know Your Customer (KYC)* verification system designed to streamline document verification with intelligent scanning, OCR extraction, and real-time validation. This system addresses common KYC challenges through smart automation and user-friendly interfaces.

## Overview

This KYC system tackles the major pain points in traditional verification processes:

- *35%* of failures from poor document scans
- *25%* from upload issues
- *15%* from incorrect document selection
- *15%* from validation failures
- *10%* from unclear rejection reasons

Our solution provides an end-to-end verification platform with smart scanning, automated quality checks, and clear user guidance.

## Key Features

### Smart Document Selection

- Clear categorization (ID Proof, Address Proof, DOB Proof)
- Sample images for each document type
- Validation to prevent wrong document uploads
- Support for Aadhaar Card and PAN Card

### Intelligent Document Scanning

- *Smart Scan Tunnel* with guided capture
- Auto-edge detection for proper framing
- Real-time quality analysis (clarity, brightness, stability)
- Live warnings for blur, glare, motion, shadows, cutoff
- AI-powered clarity scoring
- Auto-capture when optimal conditions are met

### Optimized Upload System

- Auto-compression without quality loss
- Format conversion (HEIC → JPG → PDF)
- Dynamic packet sizing based on network strength
- Duplicate document detection
- Server-side pre-validation

### OCR & Validation

- Automated text extraction using Tesseract.js
- Support for Aadhaar UID and PAN number extraction
- Real-time data validation
- Mismatch highlighting
- User confirmation screens

### Selfie Verification

- Face alignment guides
- Live capture prompts
- Auto-brightness and shadow correction
- Quality validation before submission

### Status Tracking

- Clear progress timeline: Submitted → Under Review → Approved
- Detailed rejection reasons
- Auto-fix suggestions
- KYC quality score
